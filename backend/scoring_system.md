🧭 Location & Safety Scoring — Business Overview

Our platform provides two core intelligence scores for each property:
	1.	Safety Score – an assessment of how comfortable and secure the surrounding area feels.
	2.	Location Score – a measure of how convenient the property is relative to the user’s target (event venue, coworking space, etc.).

These scores help users instantly understand where they are staying without needing to research manually.

## 1. Safety Score — “Comfort & Security Intelligence”

The Safety Score does not measure crime.
Instead, it evaluates how comfortable, active, and reassuring an area feels based on multiple signals.

The score is created by combining:

1. Environmental Signals

Collected from public mapping data, such as:
	•	Presence of street lighting
	•	Proximity to main roads or well-trafficked streets
	•	Density of cafes, restaurants, and stores (indicators of activity)
	•	Nearby public services such as police or medical centers
	•	Whether the area is residential, commercial, or industrial

These signals reflect visibility, foot traffic, and liveliness — key contributors to perceived safety.

2. Online Research Layer

The system enriches the evaluation with lightweight online information, such as:
	•	General neighborhood reputation
	•	Mentions in travel guides or city descriptions
	•	Commonly reported strengths (busy, family-friendly, central)
	•	Commonly reported concerns (isolated, industrial, poorly lit)

This is high-level sentiment analysis, not crime prediction.

3. Reasoning Engine

An AI model combines these inputs into:
	•	A 0–100 Safety Score
	•	A brief explanation
	•	A clear comfort rating (e.g., “Very Comfortable”, “Moderate”, “Low Comfort”)

This gives the user a transparent, human-understandable assessment of the area.

## 2. Location Score — “Convenience & Accessibility Intelligence”

The Location Score measures how easy it is to reach a target point from the property.

It analyzes:

1. Walking Accessibility
	•	Estimated walking distance
	•	Estimated walking time
	•	Ease of access by foot (street layout, directness of path)

2. Public Transportation Accessibility
	•	Estimated travel time using available transit routes
	•	Connectivity between the property and the destination

(For the MVP, transit time may be approximated or simplified.)

3. Combined Convenience

Based on these inputs, the system creates:
	•	A 0–100 Location Score
	•	A simple explanation (e.g., “10-minute walk”, “Well-connected by transit”)

This lets users instantly understand how close they are to the places they care about.

## 3. Summary for Business Stakeholders

Safety Score
	•	Combines environmental indicators + online neighborhood reputation
	•	Produces a comfort-focused evaluation
	•	Avoids risk and liability by not claiming crime analysis
	•	Designed to feel intuitive and trustworthy

Location Score
	•	Measures real-world accessibility
	•	Highlights closeness to event venues and coworking spaces
	•	Helps users make fast, confident decisions

Both scores create a competitive advantage, allowing the platform to deliver not just listings, but intelligent guidance tailored specifically for builders, teams, and event-driven housing needs.
