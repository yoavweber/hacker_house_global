Here’s a concise product context you can give to any LLM working on your project — it defines what Hacker House Protocol is and what the product aims to do, without locking you into current implementation details:

🏠 Hacker House Protocol — Product Context

Overview
Hacker House Protocol is a Web3 social and booking platform for builders, hackers, and digital nomads. It gamifies the process of finding teammates, booking hacker houses, and participating in tech events through an interactive 2D pixel-world interface. Each user is represented by a unique on-chain avatar (a “Cypher Kitten”), linked to their wallet and verifiable credentials.

Core Concept

The platform merges three key experiences:
	1.	Identity Layer: Every user connects a crypto wallet .
	2.	Booking Layer: Users discover and co-pay for real hacker houses near major events using crypto payments with escrow and staking mechanisms.
	3.	Social Layer: Builders can match with others by skills, POAPs, NFTs, and event attendance, forming teams and co-living groups inside virtual “hacker house servers.”

User Flow
	1.	Onboarding:
	•	Connect wallet → generate Cypher Kitten avatar.
	•	Optionally link Talent Protocol, GitHub, and POAP profiles to enrich identity.
	2.	Exploration:
	•	Enter a pixel-style map to explore cities or events.
	•	Choose between viewing hacker house listings or discovering other hackers.
	3.	Matchmaking:
	•	Filter hackers by skills, dates, or event participation.
	•	View detailed profiles with verified credentials, POAPs, and NFTs.
	4.	Booking:
	•	Browse hacker houses (available, recruiting, or virtual).
	•	Book using co-payment (USDT/USDC) — funds go to escrow.
	•	A portion is paid to the host; deposits are staked for yield (returned post-stay if no disputes).
	5.	Virtual Hacker House:
	•	After booking, users join a shared server (chat) where teammates coordinate, share progress, and prepare for events.

Revenue Model
	•	Listing Fee: ~1% platform commission from host payouts.
	•	Yield Revenue: Interest from staking deposits during stays.

⸻

Core Principles
	•	On-chain transparency: Smart contracts handle escrow and staking.
	•	Composability: Integrates with Talent Protocol, POAP, and NFT identity systems.
	•	Community-first: Focused on empowering builders to find housing, teammates, and opportunities.
	•	Playful UX: Pixel-art interface, gamified discovery, and social presence system.

⸻

MVP Scope

The MVP covers:
	•	Wallet connection + profile creation.
	•	City/event map view with toggle.
	•	Basic matchmaking with profile browsing.
	•	Hacker house listings (available/recruiting).
	•	Co-payment mock flow → virtual chat room.

The aesthetic remains cyberpunk/pixel-art, using a consistent color palette (neon purple, cyan, lime, and magenta). The tone is playful but functional — a bridge between booking app, social layer, and metaverse.
